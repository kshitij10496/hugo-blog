<p>I started this blog after I was selected as a <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2016/projects/6056916694335488/">GSoC 2016 student</a> under <a href="http://www.sympy.org/en/index.html">SymPy</a> so as to log my progress. Few weeks working into the program, it seemed that I had developed the habit of writing weekly articles. Back then, I intended to continue maintaining my blog. However soon after completing the project, I became <strong>lazy</strong> and <strong>procrastinated</strong>. üôÅ</p>
<h2 id="why-did-i-stop-posting">
  Why Did I Stop Posting?
  <a class="heading-link" href="#why-did-i-stop-posting">
    <i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>
  </a>
</h2>
<p>Whenever I felt like posting an article, I used to persuade my <em>&ldquo;conscious self&rdquo;</em> to defer because of the following reasons primarily:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Non-existent readership: <em>Who am I writing the post for?</em></strong><br>
Hardly anyone will read my posts(apart from my friends Ô∏èüôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, of course) so why bother posting them!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lack of expertise as well as experience: <em>Will my posts be helpful to anyone?</em></strong><br>
Even if someone mistakenly did read my post, they would pass it by as some novice&rsquo;s opinions on the topics that he does not even entirely understand; not that I rant too often. Personally, I believe that each article should have a purpose if it is to be deemed useful. And I was unsure about it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>During the GSoC period, I had some readership in the form of my mentors and colleagues as well as some expertise in what I was writing about. After the completion of the project, I had no temptation for updating my blog as I had no justifiable response to the 2 driving questions. Hence, I stopped posting! üòû</p>

<p>In addition to the psychological and spiritual benefits that blogging about my learnings with the world provides, a blog also provides a professional incentive, especially to a programmer. I always acknowledged these merits of maintaining a decent blog. However, I was unwilling to post until I found an honest answer to the above-mentioned two questions.</p>
<p>After some introspection, I believe I have found them and they are as follows:</p>
<p>Q1. <strong>Who am I writing the post for?</strong><br>
A: <strong>Myself, in particular; a relentless learner, in general.</strong></p>
<p>From now on, I will be writing all the posts for myself - or those who like to learn new things, make mistakes and correct themselves quickly. ü§ì</p>
<p>Q2. <strong>Will my posts be helpful to anyone?</strong><br>
A: <strong>They will if I make it simple enough and develop competence.</strong></p>
<p>I will write with the sole intention of sharing my current preoccupations and what excites me. They shall help me gain some clarity and reflect upon everything I do or happen to me. Thus, they would be useful for me at the very least. üòå</p>
<p>Q: <strong>What will I write about?</strong><br>
A: <strong>Everything and anything</strong></p>
<p>I intend to write about everything that currently occupies me, excites me and motivates me. This includes, but not restricted to, sharing:</p>
<ul>
<li>a concept I recently studied straight from my moleskine</li>
<li>a new project I&rsquo;m working on or contributing to</li>
<li>book reviews; lots of them</li>
<li>reflections on everything stupid, important and in-between</li>
</ul>
<p>The primary motivations for me to publish new articles are:</p>
<ol>
<li>challenge myself to review my understanding and presenting them effectively üòÄ</li>
<li>open up a channel of discourse with people of more diverse background üôä</li>
<li>spread the joy of learning! üéâ</li>
</ol>

</h2>
<p><strong>I pledge myself to publish a new article every Sunday for the rest of 2018.</strong></p>
<p>It will be challenging to post every week but I can assure that I will put my honest and dedicated effort into writing from now on.</p>
<p>So, see you all next Sunday for the beginning. üòÅ</p>
