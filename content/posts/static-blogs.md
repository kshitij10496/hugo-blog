I have been experimenting with different static site generators for over 3 years now.
The first time I setup my blog was for the purpose of writing weekly updates as part of my Google Summer of Code Project in May 2016.
Back then, I used Jekyll to generate the site and host it on GitHub pages.

Learnt Go some time back.
Thought of giving Hugo a try inspired by Steve Francia.
Settled on coder theme after rigourous search on [Hugo Themes](url here)
Recently, I shifted to Hugo from Ghost.

Having used Jekyll and Ghost before, I feel that Hugo provides me with the right amount of fun and control while writing content. The first signs are really good. Let's see how this goes!
