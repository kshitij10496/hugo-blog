Well, a lot of people ask me for motivation.
I have asked (and continue to ask) a lot of others for motivation.
I'm genuinely interesting in learning 

I started instrospecting: "What's stopping me from working on *that* project?"

I believe that even though motivation might be intrinsic to us.
Most of us need a stimulus to trigger us to action.
Also, for a major part of my life, I have believed that we need motivation to work. Recently, I found this is not necessarily the case.

Not everything we do needs motivation.

For example, we don't need motivation to scroll social media. (except @thoughts_of_dog, of course. :dog:)
Basically, the point I'm trying to make is that there are a lot of things don't depend on the existence of activation energy.

## Motivation Cycle
The cycle: motivation -> drive -> result and so on.
Motivation is not the only entry point in this cycle.

I've started using "work" as my entry point to getting things done.
Whenever, I have any task/project infront of me which is going to require a significant amount of work from my end (>20 hours).

I start off with something simple, possibly the most bare bones task/feature which is too trivial for me to need external motivation.
For example, when I want to tackle the huge task of writing(or testing or rewriting or documenting) a service, I start off with writing the same for a `HelloWorld` problem in the domain.
I call this technique "Finding Hello World" wherein I try to find the Hello World equivalent to the problem and work my way up.

## After Thoughts
I'm not asking you to start implementing without giving things a thought.
I'm all for thinking and planning systems before implementing them.
All I want is to do *rapid prototyping* so that I enter the cycle.
Rather than having everything 100% planned, I prefer using the 80/20 principle and allowing (even promoting randomness) to guide the 20% development effort.

There could be several drawbacks to it - I know and accept them all.
Because I'm content with trading off extreme optimisation for a saner, simpler and minimalistic life.

This method has worked well for me over the past 6 months or so.
I'll let you all know if/when I feel otherwise.
