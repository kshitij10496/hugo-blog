This past week I read about Python's iterator protocol and how the philosophy of iteration is deeply embedded into the language design. Many features that I love about Python such as list comprehensions, tuple unpacking leverage the power of iterator protocol. I wrote an [article](https://hackernoon.com/how-iterables-actually-work-in-python-65c36ff91c1e) on Medium explaining how developers can implement it and use these features much more efficiently in their day-to-day life.
