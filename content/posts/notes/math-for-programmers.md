Ref: https://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/math-for-programmers.html

One of the most inspiring articles to study mathematics, especially as a full-time programmer aka Liberal Arts degreee in Mathematics.

> Math is almost always about formalizing our "common sense" about some domain, so that we can deduce and/or prove new things about that domain. 

This is a such a powerful perspective to approach mathematics.
For example, Formal Methods are mathematically techniques related to software systems (analysis, verification etc).
Another example could be the real-life problems with travelling across cities resulting in the field of Graph Theory. (Travelling salesman problem).

> the math that you'll find useful is pretty different from the math your school thought would be useful. 

Based on my experience as a Math graduate, I can attest to this.

Think of learning math as a hobby more than anything.
