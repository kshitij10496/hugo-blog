Extremely engaging, fun pop "scientific" fiction.

# Thoughts Provoked
- The difference between "science" and "engineering". Without robust engineering skills at hand, scientific knowledge might not become a differentiating factor.
- An individual's character is revealed only during an adversity. Most seemingly strong people can be cowards.

There is nothing philosophical, in particular, throughout the storyline.
However, a bunch of facts related to basic science are tied into the narrative; no rocket science. Just the regular scientific jargon - "relativity", "evolution".

The story of the protagonist has a redemption arc but it's a bit rushed towards the end of the story.

All in all, I wouldn't read the book again. To be honest, I would prefer to watch the story as a movie.
