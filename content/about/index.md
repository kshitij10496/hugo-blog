Hey there! :wave:

This is Kshitij and you have reached my small place on the World Wide Web.


I’m a software developer, an amateur poker player and an aspiring doodle artist from India. I like to think of myself as a problem solver who prefers to leverage the potential of technology to build a better, efficient and robust (possibly, antifragile) solutions.

- Builds simple APIs for everything useful 
- Writes CLI for everything fun
- Reads daily
- Football/Poker on weekends
- Currently learning to draw, design & doodle

I designed an ugly monogram with my initals.

When I have something important/clever/funny/stupid to say, I scribble it down here, on my blog. A lot of my posts will be incoherent rough drafts wanting for an editor’s attention, but I think that’s how life is - a collection of unorganised, unexpected events with few planned ones in between.

You can reach me on the social media accounts linked on the Home page.
Alternately, you can reach me at [kshitijsaraogi@gmail.com](mailto:kshitijsaraogi@gmail.com).

Cheers! :beer:
