Hey there! :wave:

This is Kshitij and you have reached my space on the World Wide Web.

I am a software developer, and a distance running enthusiast from India.

When I have something important/clever/funny/stupid to say, I scribble it down here, on my blog. 
A lot of my posts might be incoherent rough drafts wanting for an editor’s attention, but I think that’s how life is - a collection of unorganised, unexpected events with few planned ones in between.

You can reach me on the social media accounts linked on the Home page.  
Alternately, you can reach me via [email](mailto:kshitij.saraogi@gmail.com).

Cheers! :beer:
