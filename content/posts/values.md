If I do not know who, rather what, I'm within, I cannot be successful in the long run.
This is something fundamental while reading Benjamin Franklin's autobiography, 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, The Courage to be Disliked and the Alderian Philosophy.
It makes no difference how good my rhetoric is or how good my intentions are; if I cannot trust myself, there can never be an foundation to success.
 Thus, my values, how trivial, how stupid are penned down straight from my reflections. They are the deep-seated guidelines that I believe to be indivisble and intrinsic to me; moreover, they are the yardstick I use to measure the quality and worth of my life. 
I'm not asking writing them for anyone to judge it or use it for comparison. Those are simply phrasing of the principles/metrics I use to measure myself in this moment.
As Adler says, "people can change" so I believe my values will change too, hopefully for the better. :sweat_smile:

If there is no deep integrity or fundamental character strength, the challenges of life will eventually cause true motives to surface and long term failures will replace numerous short-term successes.
For me personally, it is character that communicates most eloquently. 

“You are a confabulatory creature by nature. You are always explaining to yourself the motivations for your actions and the causes to the effects in your life, and you make them up without realizing it when you don’t know the answers. Over time, these explanations become your idea of who you are and your place in the world. They are your self… You are a story you tell yourself.”

You have to be aware of these biases and create systems that mitigate the damage, otherwise, you will never come close to making rational choices.

And sometimes, the smarter you are, the more likely you are to fall victim to biases because you think you know it all.
