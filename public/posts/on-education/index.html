Let’s talk about education today.
There are 2 complementary aspects of getting an education:
the scholarly education obtained from rigorously studying academic texts obtained from schooling. the practical education learned from life experiences dealing in the real world. I’m sure that most of us would agree that they fall somewhere on this spectrum of the wise and academic to the streetwise and practical.
Too much theory results in losing Skin in The Game while too much of hacking renders the bigger picture of your life a blur.">

<p>Let’s talk about education today.</p>
<p>There are 2 complementary aspects of getting an education:</p>
<ol>
<li>the <strong>scholarly education</strong> obtained from rigorously studying academic texts obtained from schooling.</li>
<li>the <strong>practical education</strong> learned from life experiences dealing in the real world.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m sure that most of us would agree that they fall somewhere on this spectrum of <strong>the wise and academic</strong> to <strong>the streetwise and practical</strong>.</p>
<p>Too much theory results in losing <em>Skin in The Game</em> while too much of hacking renders the bigger picture of your life a blur. Thus, a balance between the two is essential for personal growth, realising our potential and having a sense of direction in life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If people cannot write well, they cannot think well,
and if they cannot think well, others will do their thinking for them.&rdquo;
- George Orwell</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think an important way to strike this balance is to write regularly and share it with others. This is the reason why I have decided to write posts more consistently in 2019.</p>
