Ref: [Patrick Dubroy: Cold-blooded software](https://dubroy.com/blog/cold-blooded-software/)

The technology choices for a software project should be influenced by it's **expected velocity**. For projects that require hibernation and convenience of long-term reliability, the author proposes to use boring technology. I tend to agree with the idea. Moreover, it's helpful to use this criteria as a dimension when approaching new project ideas.

I also enjoyed [Jim Nielson's take](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2024/cold-blooded-software/) on this topic.
