This is such an intriguing paper on the history of computing, hence mathematics.
I highly recommend reading it yourself.

Few notes from the paper:
- Question: How is computer science connected with the human history further beyond the developments in the last century?
- Base 60 system instead of Base 10 for mathematics.
- Pergamonmusuem in Berlin houses a part of one of the clay tablets from Mesopotamia. I would have liked to see it but the museum is closed for renovations (for 14 years). So I guess I need to wait a bit longer.
- Babylonian procedures are genuine algorithms. "This is the procedure."
- Neither conditionals not iterations were used in the procedures. Almost everything was "known" - via lookup tables, or some algebra.
- Excellent examples that remind me of my middle school algebra. Just to wonder the advancements we have made in terms of technical sophistication.
- Inakibit-Anu was the first man in history to solve a computational problem that takes longer than 1 second of time on a modern electronic computer.
- Euclid's Algorithm is one of the oldest algorithms. I need to read more about it. However, I remember implementing it as part of [Advent of Code 2023 challenges](https://github.com/kshitij10496/aoc/blob/4c1592d3c41dc89f0c78a19800b29ff93cfe6e34/src/aoc/2023/day08.clj#L79-L82).
