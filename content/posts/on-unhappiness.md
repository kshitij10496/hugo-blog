Trigger: Seeing the mess manager sitting in the dark, all alone and eating his dinner inconspicously.
I had argued with me a day or two ago about the non-functional equipment.
That might have felt happy in that moment but I feel terribly sad right now.
We all the struggling in/with our lives. 

Moreover, other people have their own values to live by, and the same holds true with me. These differences would give rise to disagreements, and the combination 
of these disagreements can lead to misunderstandings. It's ceratinly not fun to be 
misunderstood or criticised, but rather a painful experience that hurts people 
deeply.

I **command** myself to never be the reason for anyone's sorrow even if it asks for me to make some sacrifice.
Be the conductor that makes people around me smile, prosper and, more importantly, feel the joy of living.

How can I do that?

Being grateful to them!
I donot mean - by praising them - lest any customary or superficial. 
I refer to genuine feeling of being thankful to a person.

Somebody has a different opinion than you on a matter - thank them for sharing their thoughts.
Neither one of you is correct, unless you agree that pandas üêº are cute.
So there is no point in bickering about your perceived "correctness" and one-upmanship.
