*tl;dr: post about posting more posts*

I have forgotten to write blog posts for over a year or have I?

## Blogging 101

I started this blog after I was selected as a [GSoC 2016 student](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2016/projects/6056916694335488/) under [SymPy](http://www.sympy.org/en/index.html) so as to log my progress. Few weeks working into the program, it seemed that I had developed the habit of writing weekly articles. Back then, I intended to continue maintaining my blog. However soon after completing the project, I became **lazy** and **procrastinated**. üôÅ

## Why Did I Stop Posting?

Whenever I felt like posting an article, I used to persuade my *"conscious self"* to defer because of the following reasons primarily:

- **Non-existent readership: _Who am I writing the post for?_**  
Hardly anyone will read my posts(apart from my friends Ô∏èüôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, of course) so why bother posting them! 

- **Lack of expertise as well as experience: _Will my posts be helpful to anyone?_**  
Even if someone mistakenly did read my post, they would pass it by as some novice's opinions on the topics that he does not even entirely understand; not that I rant too often. Personally, I believe that each article should have a purpose if it is to be deemed useful. And I was unsure about it.

During the GSoC period, I had some readership in the form of my mentors and colleagues as well as some expertise in what I was writing about. After the completion of the project, I had no temptation for updating my blog as I had no justifiable response to the 2 driving questions. Hence, I stopped posting! üòû

## Motivation

In addition to the psychological and spiritual benefits that blogging about my learnings with the world provides, a blog also provides a professional incentive, especially to a programmer. I always acknowledged these merits of maintaining a decent blog. However, I was unwilling to post until I found an honest answer to the above-mentioned two questions.

After some introspection, I believe I have found them and they are as follows:

Q1. **Who am I writing the post for?**  
A: **Myself, in particular; a relentless learner, in general.**

From now on, I will be writing all the posts for myself - or those who like to learn new things, make mistakes and correct themselves quickly. ü§ì

Q2. **Will my posts be helpful to anyone?**  
A: **They will if I make it simple enough and develop competence.**

I will write with the sole intention of sharing my current preoccupations and what excites me. They shall help me gain some clarity and reflect upon everything I do or happen to me. Thus, they would be useful for me at the very least. üòå

Q: **What will I write about?**  
A: **Everything and anything**

I intend to write about everything that currently occupies me, excites me and motivates me. This includes, but not restricted to, sharing:   

- a concept I recently studied straight from my moleskine  
- a new project I'm working on or contributing to
- book reviews; lots of them  
- reflections on everything stupid, important and in-between

The primary motivations for me to publish new articles are:  

1. challenge myself to review my understanding and presenting them effectively üòÄ
2. open up a channel of discourse with people of more diverse background üôä
3. spread the joy of learning! :tada:

## Modus Operandi

**I pledge myself to publish a new article every Sunday for the rest of 2018.**  

It will be challenging to post every week but I can assure that I will put my honest and dedicated effort into writing from now on.

So, see you all next Sunday for the beginning. :grin:
