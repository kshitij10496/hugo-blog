Ref: [Clojure from the ground up: welcome](https://aphyr.com/posts/301-clojure-from-the-ground-up-first-principles)

Really neat article (and series) about program design from first principles.

I loved the emphasis on motivation and simplicity.

Lisp is ridiculously simple to write computation.
This post does a great job at developing intuition about programming.
I found a lot of traces from SICP in the mental model.

> You could think of this structure as a treeâ€“which is a provocative idea,
because *languages* are like trees too: sentences are comprised 
of clauses, which can be nested, and each clause may have subjects 
modified by adjectives, and verbs modified by adverbs, and so on.

Extremely powerful concept.
