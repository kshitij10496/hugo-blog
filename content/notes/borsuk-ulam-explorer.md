What a pretty visulisation of the Borsuk-Ulam Theorem in realtime!

> In mathematics, the Borsukâ€“Ulam theorem states that every continuous function from an n-sphere into Euclidean n-space maps some pair of antipodal points to the same point. Here, two points on a sphere are called antipodal if they are in exactly opposite directions from the sphere's center. 

I don't distinctly recall this theorem as part of my undergraduate studies. Perhaps, I didn't appreciate the beauty back then.

Might check out Ulam's autobiography at some point as well.
