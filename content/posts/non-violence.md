It was not about being the "bigger man".
Essentially it was about becoming a principled, disciplined person.
I think it's totally normal for us to feel angry at some point.
It's not about teleology - estiology: answer what could this experience mean?
From now onwards, whenever I find myself getting frustrated at a person/thing, 
I delude myself to think of a happy memory associated with it.
It's a pretty hack I've been using lately.
Foremostly, I need to be mindful of all the moments I share with others, not that many to be honest.
I try my best to register the emotions I feel as I proceed with the conversation/activity.

The next step for me would be to acknowledge it then and there and appreciate the beauty of the person.

So whenever my heart feel anything "bad" about that person, I go to my happy place.
I remember the specific memory which I share with that person, laughing, playing, eating, talking, working.

All we can do is improve ourselves from within.
I don't think there are right choices or wrong decisions. 
It's only our subjective perspective that characterise them as such.
For me personally, I think it's rather important to take decisions that I can live with.

For example, 
In the current hiring season, I chose to opt out of the campus placements aka mass recruitments.
Given the attraction of jobs in "giant" companies, compensation package, its only reasonable for a lot of my colleagues to question it.
To me, there were a lot of factors which I would not bore you with.
I just want you to know that I took a conscious decision which I'm happy till date.
I'm grateful for my ever supportive family who trusted me with the decision rather than enforcing their expectation on me.
