### **$ git log**

[PR #11149](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11149) : Intersection of null Range and an Interval returns EmptySet  
[PR #11164](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11164) : Intersection of certain ImageSets with Intervals


In the next week, I will try to design a method to determine the range of a function in the given domain.  
This will require some digging up and a bit of research.

Looking forward to it !
