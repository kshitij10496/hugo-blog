I was quite absorbed with this trilogy over the last couple of months.

I distinctly remember reading the first chapter of [The Three-Body Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three-Body_Problem_(novel)), few years ago at the university. I had stashed it for later. So I eventually decided to pick up the 1st book in the trilogy early May, after returning from India.  

After reading the trilogy, I have a lot more questions than I did before.
Questions ranging from astrophysics to humanity's collective decision making.
There are quite a handful of ideas/theories that particularly intrigued me in the moment.

I, definitely need more time, and probably a re-read to improve my understanding of some details.

I'm grateful to the writer and translator for putting together this work.
Thoroughly enjoyed it.
