Hey there! 

This is Kshitij and you have reached my small place on the World Wide Web. :smile: :sunglasses:

I’m a software developer, an amateur poker player and an aspiring doodle artist from India. I like to think of myself as a problem solver who prefers to leverage the potential of technology to build a better, efficient and robust (possibly, antifragile) solutions.

- Builds simple APIs for everything useful 
- Writes CLI for everything fun
- Reads daily
- Football/Poker on weekends
- Currently learning to draw, design & doodle

Recently, I designed a monogram with my initals.

When I have something imporantant/clever/funny/stupid to say, I scribble it down here, on my blog. A lot of my posts will be incoherent rough drafts wanting for an editor’s attention, but I think that’s how life is - a collection of unorganised, unexpected events with few planned ones in between.

Find me at [GitHub](https://github.com/kshitij10496) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kshitij10496/). Alternately, you can reach me at [kshitijsaraogi@gmail.com](mailto:kshitijsaraogi@gmail.com).
Generally, I use **@kshitij10496** handle across all social media platforms in order to maintain a psuedo-consistency.

Cheers! :beer:
