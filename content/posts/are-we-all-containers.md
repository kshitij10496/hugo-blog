Recently, I was talking with a dear friend of mine who has a fear of riding bicycles.

Are we all just containers?
Our physical bodies are just a vessel for our consciousness.
They provide us with a structured, opaque existence at the cost of limiting our reach.
I wonder what De Broglie inspired to publish the wave theory
But this is how I feel sometimes.
 Fleeting along time, towards infinity.
