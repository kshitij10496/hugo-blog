*cross-posting from 200 Words A Day*

Let’s talk about the asymmetries in our lives today.

After reading **Fooled By Randomness** and **The Black Swan** from *Nassim Nicholas Taleb*, I am convinced by the presence and importance of asymmetries in all walks of our lives. Moreover, these asymmetries are almost always associated with a “rare”(low probability), “unforeseeable”, highly consequential event (called a *Black Swan*).

Turning a blind eye to them can result in a massive blowup – the much fraught unbecoming. Thus, we all should be aware of these asymmetries and take the necessary steps to guard our interests against them, at the bare minimum; possibly, *try to gain from them*.

In order to shore up our defences against the brewing storm of the asymmetry, the first step is to **notice** them around us.

A fundamental problem with these asymmetries is that all of them are too plain to be noticed by us in our day-to-day lives. This is why we do not acknowledge them, let alone guard against them.

For example, look at how you input the plus sign(+) and the minus sign(-) from your computer’s keyboard. Notice it yet?  
The *Shift* key looks mighty important now, doesn’t it?

We might think that such asymmetries are probably inconsequential to us and we would rather do well to not bother with them - they just complicate our world even further. However, it’s all smooth sailing for us – until the *Black Swan* hits us on our head and we are left to resent our ignorance/casual attitude.

Look around you! There are Black Swans waiting to be discovered by you.  
Let me know what you find in the comments below.
