# Background
Well, I play a lot of games, both video games and personal games with my friends. Who doesn't?
The issue I have is that I get sucked into playing, neglecting all my responsibilities.

# How do games work?
Let's admit it - Games are designed to be addicitive.
You get hooked onto them to the point of self-destruction.

Games are optimal forms of human experience.
Games are designed to have a short, fast feedback loops which provides immediate rewards.
However, the important aspect of games is that the failures are meaningful -
they too are opportunities for you to learn and optimise your learning.

# Why did I stop gaming?

A couple of years ago, I stopped playing games as rigoursly as I used to.
Why you ask? 
To be honest, I realised that I had nothing much to learn from the game.
It's similar to thinking that It’s wasteful to spend time learning skills you’ve already mastered.

Games might be optimal learning environments, but there’s no guarantee that they’re teaching skills that you actually want or need. In other words, not all learning is good learning.
