      <description>Extremely engaging, fun pop &amp;ldquo;scientific&amp;rdquo; fiction.
Thoughts Provoked     The difference between &amp;ldquo;science&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;engineering&amp;rdquo;. Without robust engineering skills at hand, scientific knowledge might not become a differentiating factor. An individual&amp;rsquo;s character is revealed only during an adversity. Most seemingly strong people can be cowards.  There is nothing philosophical, in particular, throughout the storyline. However, a bunch of facts related to basic science are tied into the narrative; no rocket science.</description>
