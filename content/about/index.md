Hey there! :wave:

This is Kshitij, and you have reached my space on the World Wide Web.
Currently, I'm based out of Berlin where I work as a software engineer mostly focusing on backend systems.

This blog is the place where I think in public. 
The posts are my attempt to share my ideas, reflections on experiences, or lessons I have learnt among many other things. 

Here are a links to know a bit more about me:
- Check out [Now](https://kshitij10496.github.io/now) to know more about my current interests.
- My public [Running Log](https://runnerblues.substack.com/) on Substack.

I have deliberately disabled comments on my articles on this site.
In case you would like to discuss anything, you can reach me on the social media accounts linked on the [Home page](https://kshitij10496.github.io).  
Alternately, via [email](mailto:kshitij.saraogi@gmail.com).

Cheers! :beer:
