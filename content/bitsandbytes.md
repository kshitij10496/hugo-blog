Welcome to Bits And Bytes!
A whole new series about some common technologies.
I will be experimenting with atleast 1 new tech every week and writing about my experience in this series.

In these posts, I will try to explain the basics about the tech/possible use cases with some examples.
I'm inspired by Richard Feynmann's technique of explaining things in layman terms.
Giving it a try and hope everything works out well!

Cheers!
