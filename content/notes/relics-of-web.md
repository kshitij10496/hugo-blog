Ref: [Relics Of The Web](https://flamedfury.com/posts/relics-of-the-web/)

Linking content on the web is a superpower.
A superpower that is easy to overlook.

The web is inherently designed for ease of discovery (through links).
At the same time, the relevancy is a burden for the individual to resolve.
We do not need any centralised service to curate a personalised experience for us.
Yet, in reality the situation is quite different.

This post provides a lot of context around web-native ideas to improve the process of discovery and relevancy.

I'm definitely going to curate a blogroll here soon.
