## Writing More 

I write daily into my journal, pour summaries of every significant learning into it as a short paragraph. Part of a digital detox tour I took, motivated by Nassim Taleb's idea of allowing uncertainty into my life.

Now, as an individual I rarely disagree with what I write in my diary. This made me question the validity of my learnings and approach to certain events. Recently, I was having a conversation with a very dear friend of mine and I realised the knowledge holes that I have in my mental models. It would be good to share my part of the story and learn from yours.

Disagreements are always very good. So, if you have any disagreements with what I have to say about a topic, I welcome you, even command you to share it with me in the comments section. That, I would consider, to be the ultimate respect I got from you.
