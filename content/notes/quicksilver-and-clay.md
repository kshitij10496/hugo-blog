Ref: [Steven Scrawls: Quicksilver and Clay](https://stevenscrawls.com/quicksilver-and-clay/)

Identity is composed from a combination of elements built using "quicksilver" or "clay".

Quicksilver represents the beliefs, opinions, and behaviours adopted at a superficial level from others. Clay represents the abilities developed from personal experiences through slow, and laborious work.

While quicksilver offers efficiency and speed, it lacks resilience; clay, on the other hand, withstands the fire of hardships.

A balance between quicksilver and clay is necessary to shape a resilient, and authentic self.
