This piece evoked the following emotions:
- Strong alignment in principle around how I envision Web technology (in general, any tech) to work.
- Reminded me of the [Low Tech Magazine](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/).
- Introduced me to the idea of Solarpunk - as a Cyberpunk derivative.

Websites/web apps built around static web pages (like this blog) are a great example of "Cheap Web".

I believe web will be better off if we focus on removing unnecessary bloat (JS libraries, complex architecture etc) from our software; not by adding new features. Less is More!
