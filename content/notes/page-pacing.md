Ref: [page pacing](https://mavengame.com/2024/02/page-pacing/)

> The best attribute of a physical book is its width.

I use the metrics of Reading Time (on Firefox Reader View) or Number of Words on web content as a measure of expected commitment.

> Thanks to digital screens destroying our brains, none of us run marathons anymore, either. We're sprinters now. When the flow of words bogs down, we set the text aside and move on to another distraction.

Really interesting. I agree with this. Lately, I forward web pages on my Kindle and read it there.

> Wherever you write and wherever your writing gets read, pace with pages.

I would be interested in trying out a page based layout design on this blog.
