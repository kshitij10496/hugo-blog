I use Apple Notes for taking quick notes, and a bin for random ideas that pop up in my head.
It has one of the best product features I have come across any note taking app.

Feature: **Automatically deleting empty notes** or **No empty notes**.

My Notion and Google Drive is filled with Docs/Sheets titled "Untitled".
This adds to the noise.
Perhaps the fundamental problem is my failure to name these docs at that moment. But sometimes, it's rather difficult to come up with names.

If I just want to note down a random idea, I do not want to structure it yet.

Apple Notes has by far the most suitable experience for noting unstructured things for me. And I'm grateful for the automatic cleanup. I wish more services had an opt-in feature.
