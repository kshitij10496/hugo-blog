Ref: https://blog.elicit.com/search-vs-vector-db/

Really interesting take on the problem of knowledge discovery.

Full-text search still remains a challenging problem.
At the same time, the increasing popularity of vector DBs, in particular, the embeddings data structure, provide another approach to the fundamental problem. A conjugation of both of these technologies can be used to build a valuable solution. 

However, questions around the efficiency of such a solution remains to be tested and monitored.
