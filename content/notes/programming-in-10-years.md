*Ref: [Peter Norvig: Teach Yourself Programming in 10 Years](http://norvig.com/21-days.html)*

I remember reading this article way back in my uni days. It reminded me of a popular quote from Richard Feynmann 

Now that I have stumbled across it after few years of experience working as a professional software engineer, I related a bit more with the content.

Ways to develop a deep understanding:
- Write more significant programs that solve problems.
- Work with experienced programmers.


> "A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming, is not worth knowing"

We need deliberate practice to continuously learn and grow.
