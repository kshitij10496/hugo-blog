        <p>It was not about being the &ldquo;bigger man&rdquo;.
Essentially it was about becoming a principled, disciplined person.
I think it&rsquo;s totally normal for us to feel angry at some point.
It&rsquo;s not about teleology - estiology: answer what could this experience mean?
From now onwards, whenever I find myself getting frustrated at a person/thing,
I delude myself to think of a happy memory associated with it.
It&rsquo;s a pretty hack I&rsquo;ve been using lately.
Foremostly, I need to be mindful of all the moments I share with others, not that many to be honest.
I try my best to register the emotions I feel as I proceed with the conversation/activity.</p>
<p>The next step for me would be to acknowledge it then and there and appreciate the beauty of the person.</p>
<p>So whenever my heart feel anything &ldquo;bad&rdquo; about that person, I go to my happy place.
I remember the specific memory which I share with that person, laughing, playing, eating, talking, working.</p>
<p>All we can do is improve ourselves from within.
I don&rsquo;t think there are right choices or wrong decisions.
It&rsquo;s only our subjective perspective that characterise them as such.
For me personally, I think it&rsquo;s rather important to take decisions that I can live with.</p>
<p>For example,
In the current hiring season, I chose to opt out of the campus placements aka mass recruitments.
Given the attraction of jobs in &ldquo;giant&rdquo; companies, compensation package, its only reasonable for a lot of my colleagues to question it.
To me, there were a lot of factors which I would not bore you with.
I just want you to know that I took a conscious decision which I&rsquo;m happy till date.
I&rsquo;m grateful for my ever supportive family who trusted me with the decision rather than enforcing their expectation on me.</p>
