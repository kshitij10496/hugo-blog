There is some intrinsic dilema in each one of us.
Whether to stay as we are irrespective of anything.
Well, you can argue that we can't change everything.
This would mean losing your natural instincts - your self.

I don't know what should you choose.
Personally, I have always thought that the best decision is the not the most efficient/optimal rather a decision which you can live with.

This is analogous to my perception of things being neither wrong nor right.
This way of thinking has often come to my rescue.
