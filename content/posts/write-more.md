I have forgotten to write blog posts for over a year or have I?

### The Reflection
I started this blog after I was selected as a [GSoC 2016 student](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2016/projects/6056916694335488/) under [SymPy](http://www.sympy.org/en/index.html). It was a requirement of the program that the student maintain a blog to log his work updates and my mentors suggested me to write weekly posts. Few weeks working on the project, it seemed that I had developed the habit of writing weekly articles. At that time, I intended to continue writing blog posts regularly. However, as soon as I completed the project successfully, I became **lazy** and **procrastinated**.

Whenever I felt like writing an article, I used to persuade my *"conscious self"* to defer because of the following reasons primarily:

- **Non-existent readership**:
Who am I writing the post for? 
Hardly anyone will read my posts (apart from your dear friends) so why bother writing it! 

- **Lack of expertise as well as experience**:
Will my voice be taken seriously?
Even if someone mistakenly did read my post, they would pass it by as some novice's opinions on the programming topics that he does not even entirely understand.

During the project, I had some readership in the form of my mentors and colleagues as well as some expertise in what I was writing about. After the conclusion of the project, I used to give into the temptation of not updating my blog as I had no justifiable response to these questions. Hence, I stopped writing and posting!

### The Motivation

In addition to the psychological and spiritual benefits that blogging about my learnings with the world provides, a blog also provides a professional incentive, especially to a programmer. I always acknowledged these merits of maintaining a decent blog. However, I was unwilling to write for the sake of my selfish needs until I found an honest answer to the above-mentioned two questions.

Few months passed in search of the answers but now I believe I have found them and they are as follows:

Q1. **Who am I writing the post for?**
Ans: **Myself!**

From now on, I will be writing all the posts for myself. No, I am not being narcissistic; I intend to use this justification to imply that I am no longer concerned with how many people do read my posts and what opinion they form of me. Using the Feynmann Learning Technique, I have come to the conclusion that, for me, there is no more thorough way to understand a concept than to write about it elaborately. Hence, my blog posts will foster me to review my understanding and challenge me to explore new topics. In short, I am doing this only because I want to grow as a person and a developer. Few years down the line, I expect this blog will be the timeline of my journey and track my progress through time.

Q2. **Will the readers take my concern and opinion seriously?**
Ans: **They will if I develop competence.**

I will write with the sole intention of sharing the current(that is, at the time of writing) preoccupation and what excites me. I want to show the world what I  know about my speciality; be it related to software, books or sports. This way when you have a question about my specialty, you can approach me for help and we both can learn through collaboration.

Through writing frequent blog posts, **my goal is to attract *enthusiasts* in my field so I can share ideas with them and create something of value that persists beyond us.**

### The Action
Now that I accept my fears and have answers to all my inhibitions, I feel confident in facing them head-on. 

Hence, **I pledge myself to write a weekly blog post for the rest of 2017 starting today. I will show up. No more excuses! Period.**  

I know that it might be difficult to keep up with the challenge every week but at least, I can assure that I will put my honest and dedicated effort into writing from now on.

So, see you all next Sunday with my first programming post.
