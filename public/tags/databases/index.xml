      <description>Lately, I have been experimenting with running PostgreSQL in a Docker container and communicating with it - from an application. This article documents my experience, learnings and methodology.
Problem I have got a lot of small personal projects which use separate databases.
Each DB is associated with a unique configuration (combination of user, password, name) which as exported as environment variables in the relevant applications.
Now, this soon got messy as my machine was polluted with lots of DBs and their configurations.</description>
