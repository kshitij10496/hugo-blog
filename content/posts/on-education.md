*cross-posting from 200 Words A Day*

Let’s talk about education today.

There are 2 complementary aspects of getting an education:

1. the **scholarly education** obtained from rigorously studying academic texts obtained from schooling.
2. the **practical education** learned from life experiences dealing in the real world.

I’m sure that most of us would agree that they fall somewhere on this spectrum of **the wise and academic** to **the streetwise and practical**.

Too much theory results in losing *Skin in The Game* while too much of hacking renders the bigger picture of your life a blur. Thus, a balance between the two is essential for personal growth, realising our potential and having a sense of direction in life.

I think an important way to strike this balance is to write regularly and share it with others. This is the reason why I have decided to write posts more consistently in 2019.
