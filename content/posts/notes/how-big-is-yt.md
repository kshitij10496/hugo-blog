I don't see a lot of talk about the "denominator problem".
This article does a great job at providing context to the discussion of normalizing data.
It's not too difficult to skew most datasets to fit our viewpoint.
As a undergrad student, I had shared in this guilty pleasure too.
And I would not be surprised if a similar practice exists in some of the industry.
Not that it's anybody's fault, I belive it's just part of our nature.

Anyways, I really appreciate Ethan sharing the process here.
The linked articles about building URLs for YouTube can be valuable from engineering PoV.
Thanks for Tubestats as well.

> I believe that high level data like this should be published regularly for all large user-generated media platforms. These platforms are some of the most important parts of our digital public sphere, and we need far more information about whatâ€™s on them, who creates this content and who it reaches.
