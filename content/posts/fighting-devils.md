I've met a lot of people who have achieved a lot in their life, for their age.
But I see them struggling with a want for personal congruency and so do I.
Often this leads to resentment which eventually ends up in chronic depression.

I think defining a value system is an important first step to solving the problem.
I'm pretty sure my value system, the metrics I used and my targets are all dynamic and will probably 
no longer resemble what I currently strive for.
