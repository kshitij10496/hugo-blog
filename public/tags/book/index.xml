      <description>I was quite absorbed with this trilogy over the last couple of months.
I distinctly remember reading the first chapter of The Three-Body Problem, few years ago at the university. I had stashed it for later. So I eventually decided to pick up the 1st book in the trilogy early May, after returning from India.
After reading the trilogy, I have a lot more questions than I did before. Questions ranging from astrophysics to humanity&amp;rsquo;s collective decision making.</description>

      <description>Extremely engaging, fun pop &amp;ldquo;scientific&amp;rdquo; fiction.
Thoughts Provoked The difference between &amp;ldquo;science&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;engineering&amp;rdquo;. Without robust engineering skills at hand, scientific knowledge might not become a differentiating factor. An individual&amp;rsquo;s character is revealed only during an adversity. Most seemingly strong people can be cowards. There is nothing philosophical, in particular, throughout the storyline. However, a bunch of facts related to basic science are tied into the narrative; no rocket science.</description>
